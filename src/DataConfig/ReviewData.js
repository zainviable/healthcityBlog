      "I have benefitted enormously from my sessions with [my psychologist]. He has given me the means to bring trauma out of my subconscious and out of my control, into my conscious mind with the knowledge that I can control it if I keep trying.  It has been very difficult for me, notably discerning between a panic attack and a heart attack ( I am a heart patient). Another difficulty has been dealing with the loss of mother. All in all, with the guidance of [my psychologist], I have felt safe to address this  and other traumas, and to talk about them openly for the first time in my life. I am now in the process of recovery, I have found invaluable in understanding myself better and learning step by step how to manage myself better. I know there is a long way to go,  but I am also sure I can come through this with your continued help, support and guidance.",

As the conversations were more promising than I imagined, I am going back to work on  full time.  I am in debt to you for your advice and help in this rather strange period of my life.",

I would like to thank you for all the support you have given me even when I had completely lost hope in everything and felt my life was spiralling out of control. Also thank you for the letter, support and advice in helping me to deal with my problems. Once  again thank you so much for everything, you have been amazing.",

      "This has been quite a while, but I wanted to thank you for all your help. I passed my exam last week so I'm greatly relieved. I have decided that the next thing for me is to see a personal trainer as I think this is what will make the biggest difference.  I  will think of you if I ever need more help again, as we could dig a lot deeper if we did the full on therapy sessions, but for now I'm OK with how things are.",
