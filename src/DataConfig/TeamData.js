I was born and raised in London and didn’t like school much however I did enjoy drama more than I did maths. Along with a high percentage of teenagers I too started to smoke and continued for over 10 years. I wanted to preserve my voice and so I quit smoking with hypnotherapy, this allowed me to perform some great clear speeches at drama school. Later, I was awarded my Masters degree and then relocated to California where I worked in front of the camera, on stage and in a voice recording booth. My interest in the medical field peaked, so I trained to get my Phlebotomy license. During my years in California I coached International Doctors and prepped them for their foreign medical exams, I also coached law students at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. After a good few years on the West Coast I then found myself on the East Coast in New York where I continued coaching this time at New York Law School, New York University – School of Medicine and New York Institute of Technology. The winters were rough so I returned back home and began training nurses, doctors and students in venepuncture and cannulation at some of London's leading hospitals. I trained as a Cognitive Behavioural Hypnotherapist at the UK College of Hypnosis & Hypnotherapy and in April 2015 I celebrated my 11th year of being smoke free…I've turned over many leaves and hope I can help you turn a few.",

      "I provide cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), EMDR counselling, trauma counselling, and couples counselling. I have over 15 years working in the mental health and addiction field in the UK and USA. I have counselled your every day person to a few famous people seeking help in their relationships. I use EMDR along with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT) to help process trauma faster than regular talk therapy as EMDR uses eye movement to process the traumatic events affecting the person seeking treatment. It is a proven treatment for war veterans with PTSD and used in place of medication. In working with couples, I help you learn your love language, process the break down or issues in the relationship and help you work through any differences or infidelties you may have. I help build relationships to become stronger by focusing on how each couple came together to form a partnership in the first place and building on this to recognise each other's strengths, love, and friendship as a couple. I also work with teens and adults with anxiety, depression, ADHD, trauma, phobias, OCD, couple issues,  post traumatic stress, addiction, stress, odd, IED, anger management, and bi polar disorder. I also work with teens and adults with Asperger's who are finding it difficult to build a social network or adjust to their lives due to new events or issues taking place. I provide family therapy using the family systems method. I do work with the addiction population but only in conjunction with those who are on assisted treatment through various NHS trusts and are testing negative. As a life coach, I empower individuals to reach their goals whilst finding their purpose in life. We set standards, use solution focused techniques and work on helping each person strive for what they want in life! It IS achievable--just believe and you will receive! I have a Bsc Honors in Substance Misuse Studies from the University of West London, and Msc with Honors from Kaplan University. I am HCPC registered as a counselling psychologist.
